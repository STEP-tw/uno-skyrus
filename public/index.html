              <p align="justify" class="text">Once the cards are shuffled each player is dealt 7 cards. The remainder of the deck is
                placed face down to form a DRAW pile. The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile.
                If an Action Card is the first one turned up from
                the DRAW pile, certain rules apply (See FUNCTIONS OF ACTION CARDS). The person to the left of the dealer
                starts play. He/she has to match the card on the DISCARD pile, either by number, color or symbol. For
                example, if the card is a red 7, the
                player must put down a red card or any color 7. Alternatively, the player can put down a Wild card (See
                FUNCTIONS OF ACTION CARDS). If the player doesn’t have a card to match the one on the DISCARD pile, he/she
                must take a card from the DRAW
                pile. If the card picked up can be played, the player is free to put it down in the same turn. Otherwise,
                play moves on to the next person in turn. Players may choose not to play a playable card from their hand. If
                so, the player must draw a
                card from the DRAW pile. If playable, that card can be put down in the same turn, but the player may not use
                a card from the hand after the draw.

              <span class="sub-heading">Functions Of The Action Cards</span>
              <p class="text">The functions of the Action Cards, and when they may be played, are set out below.</p>
              <p class="text"><span class="third-heading">
                  Draw Two Card</span> - When this card is played, the next person to play must draw 2 cards and miss his/her
                turn. This card can only be played on matching colors and other Draw Two cards. If turned up at the beginning
                of play, the same rule applies.
              </p>
              <p class="text"><span class="third-heading">
                  Reverse Card</span> - This simply reverses direction of play. Play to changes direction to the right, and
                vice versa. The card may only be played on a matching color or on another Reverse card. If this card is
                turned up at the beginning of play, the dealer goes first, then play moves to the right instead of the left.
              </p>
              <p class="text"><span class="third-heading">
                  Skip Card</span> - The next player to play after this card has been laid loses his/her turn and is
                “skipped”. The card may only be played on a matching color or on another Skip card. If a Skip card is turned
                up at the beginning of play, the player to the left of the dealer is “skipped”, hence the player to the left
                of that player commences play.
      
              </p>
              <p class="text"><span class="third-heading">
                  Wild Card</span> - The person playing this card calls for any color to continue the play, including the one
                currently being played, if so desired. A Wild card can be played at any time - even if the player has another
                playable card in the hand. If a Wild card is turned up at the beginning of play, the person to the left of
                the dealer determines the color, which continues play.
              </p>
              <p class="text"><span class="third-heading">
                  Wild Draw Four Card</span> - This is the best card to have. The person who plays it calls the color that
                continues play. Also, the next player has to pick up 4 cards from the DRAW pile and miss his/her turn.
                Unfortunately, the card can only be played when the player holding it does not have a card in his/her hand to
                match the color on the DISCARD pile. If the player holds matching numbers or Action Cards, however, the Wild
                Draw Four card may be played. A player holding a Wild Draw Four may choose to bluff and play the card
                illegally, but if he/she is caught certain rules apply (See PENALTIES). If this card is turned up at the
                beginning of play, it is returned to the deck and another card is picked.

              <span class="sub-heading">Going Out</span>
                  <p align = "justify" class="text">
                    When a player has only one card left, he/she must yell “UNO” (meaning “one”). Failure to do this results
                    in having to pick up 2 cards from the DRAW pile. This is only necessary, however, if he/she is caught by
                    one of the other players (See PENALTIES).
                    Once a player has no cards left, the hand is over, Then the player will be declared as the winner.
                    If no player is out of cards by the time the DRAW pile is depleted, the deck is reshuffled and play
                    continues.

                    A player who forgets to say “UNO” before his/her second-to-last card touches the DISCARD pile. Players may not be
                    caught for failure to say “UNO” until his/her second-to-last card touches the DISCARD pile. A player may also not be
                    caught for failure to say “UNO” after the next player begins his/her turn. “Beginning a turn” is defined as either
                    taking a card from the DRAW pile or drawing a card from your hand to play.
